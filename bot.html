          <h1>What is Vindinium?</h1>
          <blockquote><p>Vindinium is a multi-player turn based dungeon crawling game.
            Each player has one hero that can move across a map. The objective
            is for players to amass the maximum quantity of gold during a predetermined
            number of turns.
            <br>Players must take control of gold mines to produce gold;
            however, gold mines are protected by goblins. When a player defeats a goblin, he becomes
            owner of the gold mine and receives one gold per turn. Furthermore,
            the goblin now defends the mine against other players.
            <br>Heroes can fight each other. The survivor gets control of all his opponent's gold mines.
            The killed hero is immediately respawned with all his gold, but no mines.
            When going to the tavern, heroes can buy beers for gold, restoring their life points.
            <br>The objective is to create a computer program (a bot) that plays the game of
            Vindinium as intelligently as possible. It is recommended that you use one of
            the starter packages as a starting point.<p></blockquote>

      <p>Trotskybot was the name of my Vindinium Bot, themed around the Soviet Union.
         His stratagey was all about capturing mines. He would only attack or run away if
         an enemy entered his "Fight/Flightbox", an imaginary box two units around him.
         If the enemies health was less than his he would attack and if it was more he would try
         to run in a the direct opposite direction from the enemy.</p>
