          <h1>What is Vindinium?</h1>
          <blockquote><p>Vindinium is a multi-player turn based dungeon crawling game.
            Each player has one hero that can move across a map. The objective
            is for players to amass the maximum quantity of gold during a predetermined
            number of turns.
            <br>Players must take control of gold mines to produce gold;
            however, gold mines are protected by goblins. When a player defeats a goblin, he becomes
            owner of the gold mine and receives one gold per turn. Furthermore,
            the goblin now defends the mine against other players.
            <br>Heroes can fight each other. The survivor gets control of all his opponent's gold mines.
            The killed hero is immediately respawned with all his gold, but no mines.
            When going to the tavern, heroes can buy beers for gold, restoring their life points.
            <br>The objective is to create a computer program (a bot) that plays the game of
            Vindinium as intelligently as possible. It is recommended that you use one of
            the starter packages as a starting point.<p></blockquote>

      <h2>Vindinium in our Class</h2>
      <p>If there is something all coders like to its compete! When our teacher introduced
      Vindinium into our class it started a truly electric competition for the top spot on the
      leaderboard. This competition eventually devovled into a full on tournament
      pitting all members of the class against each other in an organized bracket. The culmination
      of which was the final match that is playing above. </p>

      <br>
      <p>Trotskybot was the name of my Vindinium Bot, themed around the Soviet Union.
         His stratagey was all about capturing mines. He would only attack or run away if
         an enemy entered his "Fight/Flightbox", an imaginary box two units around him.
         If the enemies health was less than his he would attack and if it was more he would try
         to run in a the direct opposite direction from the enemy.</p>

        <p>The code on the left is a direct exerpt from the inner workings of TrotskyBot
          code uses the variables bot.moves1, bot.moves2 etc... closestBot,
          runLoc, BOX_SIZE, fightFlightBox and trajectory The purpose of this code is
          to create a fight flight mechanism with arrays This code runs whenever the turn starts"
          <br><br>
          Line 1) creates a 4 loop that iterates through 4 i's<br>
          Line 2)pushes an array of the x and y positon of bot[""bot""+i] into bot[""moves""+i]<br>
          Line 3)does nothing (is comment)<br>
          Line 4)runs the next block of code if bot[""bot""+i] is the nearest bot<br>

          Line 9)creates an aray (runLoc)  of the difference between closest enemies' new and old positions<br>
          Line 10) if that runs the next bloc of code if there is an enemy bot in the fight/flight box <br>
