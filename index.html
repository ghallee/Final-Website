        <p>Once called 'Intersession' Expeditions is now a
         traveling show of educational classes. This website was
         created for a Computer Science class by a young man known as
         Grant Hallee. (See about me page)</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this class is to advance our computer
         literacy. As the wonderful Mr Hesby once put it
         "Computer Literacy is no longer for a specific group of
         people but part of our everyday life.  Computers are used in many
         ways to make our lives better and the more we understand how they work
         and what theyâ€™re capable of, the more they can be utilized by everyone."
         In this class we will all advance toward those high-minded and lofty goals.<p>
